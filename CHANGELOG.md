-Cache http (use it carefully, default template is not compatible with this cache) :
	- if you don't know http specification, learn it first http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html
	- esi tag integrated, use {render_esi path="http://your-taget.tld/resource"}
	- if no reverse proxy detected, html is render instead of esi tag
	- if you can't install a reverse proxy like varnish, use the HttpCache (just uncomment line 14 in web/index.php file)
